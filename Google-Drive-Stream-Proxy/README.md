An open source code which streams using the host itself to provide the initiation of proxy. Demo will be disabled due to its current status.

"Once again, I'll make this script as a beta version to look for further patches and bugs for this little boy" -Modifier

## Beta type example
```php
<?php
// Drive Proxy Class
require_once(__DIR__ .'/class.DriveProxy.php');

// Create new class for id
$drive = new DriveProxy();
$drive->driveid('');
$drive->proxy_link()
?>
```
